# ARCHITECTURE

This document outlines the basic architecture for a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) SDK designed to help users easily implement RAG instances. The design is informed by common RAG patterns, such as those described in tutorials like building a RAG chatbot with LangChain.js and Next.js.

## Core Components of a RAG System

A typical RAG system, as often implemented for chatbots or question-answering systems, involves several key components that work together to retrieve relevant information and generate informed responses. An SDK for RAG aims to simplify the integration and management of these components.

1.  **Data Ingestion & Processing:**
    *   **Connectors:** Mechanisms to connect to various data sources (e.g., local files like PDFs/text, web URLs, databases like DataStax Astra).
    *   **Loaders & Parsers:** Tools for loading raw data and parsing it into a usable format (e.g., extracting text from documents).
    *   **Chunking:** Strategies to split large documents into smaller, manageable chunks suitable for embedding and retrieval.
    *   **Embedding Generation:** Modules for transforming text chunks into vector embeddings using models (e.g., from OpenAI or open-source alternatives). This is crucial for semantic search.

2.  **Vector Store Management:**
    *   **Abstraction Layer:** A consistent API for interacting with various vector databases (e.g., DataStax Astra, Pinecone, ChromaDB, FAISS, Weaviate, local in-memory stores).
    *   **Storage Operations:** Functions for creating, populating (indexing embeddings), updating, and deleting vector stores or collections within them.
    *   **Metadata Handling:** Support for storing and filtering based on metadata associated with the embeddings.

3.  **Retrieval Mechanism:**
    *   **Query Transformation:** Converting a user's natural language query into a vector embedding using the same model as the document embeddings.
    *   **Similarity Search:** Core logic for searching the vector store to find the most relevant document chunks based on vector similarity (e.g., cosine similarity, dot product).
    *   **Re-ranking (Optional):** Advanced techniques to refine search results before passing them to the LLM.
    *   **Contextualization:** Formatting the retrieved chunks into a coherent context string.

4.  **Augmented Generation (LLM Interaction):**
    *   **LLM Integration:** Connectors for various Large Language Models (LLMs) like OpenAI's GPT series, Anthropic's Claude, or open-source models via interfaces like Hugging Face Transformers.
    *   **Prompt Engineering:** Utilities to construct effective prompts that combine the retrieved context with the user's original query. This might include templates and strategies for context injection.
    *   **Response Generation:** Sending the augmented prompt to the LLM and receiving the generated response.
    *   **Streaming (Optional):** Support for streaming responses from the LLM for better user experience. The Vercel AI SDK provides excellent utilities (like `streamText` and `toAIStreamResponse`) for this in a Node.js/Next.js environment.

5.  **Orchestration & Workflow (The SDK's Core Value):**
    *   **Pipeline Management:** A high-level API or framework to define and run the entire RAG pipeline (e.g., `query -> embed_query -> retrieve_context -> augment_prompt -> generate_response`).
    *   **Configuration Management:** Easy ways to configure API keys, model choices, vector store connections, chunking strategies, etc.
    *   **Caching (Optional):** Mechanisms to cache embeddings or LLM responses to improve performance and reduce costs.
    *   **Logging & Monitoring:** Tools for developers to understand the internal workings and performance of their RAG application.

## SDK Implementation Focus

The RAG SDK will provide modules, classes, and functions to cover these core areas, enabling developers to:

-   **Easily Connect & Process Data:** Provide pre-built loaders and transformers for common data sources and types.
    ```typescript
    // Example (conceptual)
    // Assuming 'sdk' is our RAG SDK namespace
    const dataLoader = new sdk.DataLoader({ sourceType: "web_url", url: "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formula_One" });
    const documents = await dataLoader.loadAndChunk();
    ```
-   **Simplify Embedding & Storage:** Offer straightforward ways to generate embeddings and store them in a chosen vector store with minimal configuration.
    ```typescript
    // Example (conceptual)
    // Assuming 'sdk' and a VectorStore class/interface. 
    // For Astra DB, this might wrap '@datastax/astra-db-ts'.
    const vectorStore = new sdk.AstraDBVectorStore({
      token: process.env.ASTRA_DB_APPLICATION_TOKEN!,
      endpoint: process.env.ASTRA_DB_API_ENDPOINT!,
      namespace: process.env.ASTRA_DB_NAMESPACE!,
      collectionName: "your_collection_name"
    });
    // Documents would be an array of { pageContent: string, metadata: object }
    await vectorStore.addDocuments(documents, { embeddingModelName: "text-embedding-3-small" });
    ```
-   **Streamline Retrieval & Generation:** Offer a cohesive interface for querying the RAG system.
    ```typescript
    // Example (conceptual)
    // Assuming an RAGPipeline class that might use Vercel AI SDK for streaming
    const ragPipeline = new sdk.RAGPipeline({
      vectorStore: vectorStore, // Instance from above
      llm: openai('gpt-4o'), // Using Vercel AI SDK's OpenAI provider
      embeddingModelName: "text-embedding-3-small" // Consistent model name for embeddings
    });
    // The query method might return a stream or a final response object
    const result = await ragPipeline.query("What were the key F1 rule changes in 2022?");
    // Handle the result, which could be a stream (e.g., result.stream) or text (e.g., result.text)
    // For streaming with Next.js, one might use `result.toAIStreamResponse()` if 'result' is a StreamTextResult object.
    console.log(await result.text()); // Or iterate over a stream
    ```

### Key SDK Abstractions:

-   `DataSource`/`Loader`: For ingesting data.
-   `TextSplitter`/`Chunker`: For preparing data.
-   `EmbeddingModel`: Interface for different embedding providers.
-   `VectorStore`: Interface for different vector databases.
-   `Retriever`: Encapsulates the logic for fetching relevant documents.
-   `LLM`: Interface for different language model providers.
-   `PromptTemplate`: For constructing prompts.
-   `RAGChain`/`RAGPipeline`: To orchestrate the end-to-end process.

This SDK aims to lower the barrier to entry for building robust and customizable RAG applications by abstracting away much of the underlying complexity while still offering flexibility for advanced users.
